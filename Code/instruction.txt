Install node.js on your system.

To check if node is already on your system, type: node -v 
on your command prompt/terminal.

Change directory to the directory with package.json and type: npm install
It will install all the dependencies eg, express, ejs

Type: npm run watch

You should see ‘Express is running on port 3000!’
Connected to database
http://localhost:3000 should serve a page with styled with bootstrap

Install mysql on your system.
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/installing.html

Import the sql script - import.sql

I am not sure how to setup phpmyadmin

----------------------------
Install node.js on your system.

To check if node is already on your system, type: node -v 
on your command prompt/terminal.

Change directory to the directory with package.json and type: npm install
It will install all the dependencies eg, express, ejs

Type: npm run watch

You should see ‘Express is running on port 3000!’
Connected to database
http://localhost:3000 should serve a page with styled with bootstrap

----------------------------
Issue with npm mysql package, used mysql2 packaged instead

  errno: 1251,
  sqlMessage: 'Client does not support authentication protocol requested by server; consider upgrading MySQL client',
  sqlState: '08004',
  fatal: true
